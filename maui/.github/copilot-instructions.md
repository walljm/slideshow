# Slideshow MAUI App Development Guidelines

This is a .NET MAUI application that creates a cross-platform slideshow viewer for Windows and macOS. The app replaces a Node.js server with native file reading capabilities and uses a WebView to display HTML-based slideshows. The application operates automatically without user controls, loading all configuration from a bundled config.json file.

## Architecture Overview

- **Minimal MAUI UI**: Clean interface with only WebView component
- **WebView Component**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript slideshow interface  
- **Service Layer**: File system operations and configuration management
- **Automatic Operation**: Configuration loaded from bundled config.json, no user controls
- **Bridge Communication**: JavaScript evaluation for MAUI-WebView communication
